## What does semantic HTML mean?

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to human users.

## Why use `strong` and `em` instead of `b` and `i`?

In semantic HTML, tags like `<b>` for bold, and `<i>` for italic should not be used since they just represent formatting/styling, and provide no indication of meaning/structure. The semantically correct thing to do is use `<strong>` and `<em>`. These tags will have the same bold and italic styles applied, while demonstrating meaning and structure.
